# HammersAndSmithing
This mod adds hammers, new smithing recipes and smithing tables required for crafting.

Materials changes:

- Added copper items

- Added golden items which are better than iron items (vanilla golden items are still obtainable)

- Changed durability of: wooden, stone and vanilla golden tools

- Changed damage of: wooden, stone and iron tools

- Changed mining levels:

copper is mineable with stone pickaxe, iron with copper pickaxe, gold with iron etc.
Hammers:

- Used for smithing

- Can also be used as a weapon:

Deals more damage than sword, but less than axe
Has the lowest attack speed of all tools
Can hit many targets with one hit (like sword)
Attacking slows enemy down for a short time
 

Smithing Tables:

- Can be used to upgrade your gear:

for example copper items can be reinforced with iron nuggets
- There are four smithing tables: copper, iron, golden and diamond

- Vanilla smithing table is disabled

- Netherite items can be crafted with Diamond Smithing Table

 

Blocked recipes:

- Tools and armors are uncraftable until you place appropriate smithing table near crafting table.

- These smithing tables are expensive so you will have to collect many ingots and diamonds before you will be able to craft diamond tools.

 

Villagers:

- Overwritten vanilla trade offers

- Villagers now sell golden items instead of diamond

 

Other:

- Changed loot from chests (not all)

- Zombies and skeletons don't spawn with golden armor

- Wither skeletons spawn with iron swords
